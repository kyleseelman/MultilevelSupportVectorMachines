# Multi-level Support Vector Machines

My undergraduate thesis on a multi-level framework for support vector machines

# Abstract 

A support vector machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier defined by an optimal separating hyperplane. The support vector machine is desirable for its ability to find an optimal separating hyperplane even for high-dimensional nonlinear data. This paper will cover the basics of support vector machines and introduce the idea of a multilevel support vector machine, a method for classification that greatly reduces the computational time of traditional SVMs, without sacrificing accuracy.
